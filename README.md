RECENT UPDATES

UI Overhaul & SEO
We have implemented a modern, premium user interface with a fixed navigation bar, hero section, and dedicated feature areas. The site is now optimized for SEO with semantic meta tags and social sharing data for Facebook and Twitter. The design is fully responsive, ensuring it looks great on mobile devices.

Code Refactoring
We improved the codebase by separating authentication logic into a dedicated auth.js file, keeping the main dashboard logic in app.js. The CSS has also been refactored to use variables for consistent theming, adding premium visual effects like backdrop blur and layered shadows.

Features Added
The new Admin Dashboard allows for user management, deposit and withdrawal tracking, and reporting. Users now have their own dashboard to view personal balances and transaction history. We also added interactive modals for smooth data entry and a toast notification system for better user feedback.
